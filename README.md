# Fitbit User Data Analysis Project
For this project, a dataset which contained the usage information of 33 Fitbit users was cleaned, transformed, and then analysed using R. Usage behaviour such as frequency of use for sleep tracking, weight logging, and general usage was first analysed. This was followed by an analysis of user health metrics, such as exercise hours per week, hours asleep, and time taken to fall asleep. By identifying patterns in usage behaviour and by profiling users based on their health metrics, recommendations for marketing and product development were crafted.
